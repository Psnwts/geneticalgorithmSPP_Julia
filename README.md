# geneticalgorithmSPP_Julia
Genetic Algorithm (GA) for the Set Packing Problem (SPP) in Julia.

# Executing the algorithm and visualizing the obtained solution

First go to ```geneticalgorithmSPP_Julia/src``` then execute the following commands:

Launching the Julia REPL:

```shell
julia

```

Executing the genetic algorithm for an instance of the (SPP):

```shell
plot_experimentGA("Data1/pb_100rnd0100.dat")
```

Instances of the (SPP) are in the ```Data1/```and ```Data2/```directories:

The resulting graphical representation would be similar to the following:
